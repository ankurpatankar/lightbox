# lightbox
This app pulls images from imgur and shows them in a gallery.

Clicking on the images from the gallery lets you see larger versions of the images in a lightbox

You also have the ability to scroll through the images using previous and next navigation.

The app is built such that the images are cycled through. That way if you reach the end of the images it loops back to the first and vice-versa.
